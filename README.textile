h1. ChoroMap

ChoroMap is a simple ruby script (and some blank maps from wikimedia) to make a colorized map of the USA based on count data. That is, given a data file with an identifier (ie. a FIPS code or state abbreviation) and an associated count (ie. number of bars, number of sex offenders, unemployment, etc ) you can quickly and easily generate a map like the one shown here:

"The Country Is Bleeding":http://flowingdata.com/2009/11/04/unemployment-2004-to-present-the-country-is-bleeding/

Which, incidentally, is what inspired this script in the first place.



h2. USAGE:

<pre><code>
    ./choro_map.rb <datafile> <map_type> > <output.svg>
</code></pre>


Where it is assumed your <datafile> has rows that look like: <identifier> "\t" <count>
and <identifier> is a county code or state abbreviation depending on whether <map> is
"usa" or "counties"
